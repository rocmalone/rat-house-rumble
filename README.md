Rat House Rumble (RHR) is an arena shooter set in a 3D-scanned house. You can play RHR solo or with up to four players in local splitscreen. 
[Download the game here from its itch.io page](https://rocmalone.itch.io/rat-house-rumble). This repo houses most of the scripts used in the game's creation.

### Mission
RHR is an exploration of the Godot engine's 3D performance and the capability of the iPhone 13 Pro's Lidar sensor (hint: it is *just capable enough*).

It is a tribute to some long term friendships, and an era of my life that I will always remember fondly.

For those curious about the story behind the game and the challenges in bringing it to life, stay tuned for a retrospective blog post coming soonâ„¢. TLDR; there are some good reasons AAA studios don't use 3D scanned assets/environments, but if you're a solo-dev and not an artist you should seriously consider using 3D-scanning for key assets (think weapons & hand-held items).
