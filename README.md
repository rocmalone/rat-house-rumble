Rat House Rumble (RHR) is an arena shooter set in a 3D-scanned house. You can play RHR solo or with up to four players in local splitscreen. 
[Download the game here from its itch.io page](https://rocmalone.itch.io/rat-house-rumble). This repo houses most of the scripts used in the game's creation.

RHR is an exploration of the Godot engine's 3D performance and the capability of the iPhone 13 Pro's Lidar sensor.

For those curious about the story behind the game and the challenges in bringing it to life, stay tuned for a retrospective blog post coming soonâ„¢. TLDR; there are some good reasons AAA studios don't use 3D scanned assets/environments, but if you're a solo-dev and not an artist you should seriously consider using 3D-scanning for key assets (think weapons & hand-held items).
